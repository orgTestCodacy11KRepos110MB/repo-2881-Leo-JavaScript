Article review: <[How to select the Node.js Version](https://medium.com/@Chris1993/how-to-select-the-node-js-version-3a6ae31be18c)>

When our local development environment needs to install Node.js 8.0.0 and Node.js 17.0.0 at the same time, how to do it?

Next, I will share 3 tools for managing the Node.js version of the local environment.

## 1. nvm

‚≠ê *Github stars: 60K+*

[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) allows you to quickly install and use different versions of node via the command line.

nvm can only be used in projects for macOS and Linux users. If you are Windows users, you can use [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows), [nodist](https://github. com/marcelklehr/nodist) or [nvs](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs).

### Installation

macOS download method:

```bash
# Method 1 Browser open the following link to download
https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/v0.39.1/install.sh
# After the download is complete, install it through the command
sh install.sh

# Method 2 ‚úÖ
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash

# Method 3
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
````

If you encounter problems during the installation process, you can check the [nvm supplementary notes](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#additional-notes).

### Common commands

```bash
nvm ls # view version install all versions
nvm ls-remote # View all remote Node.js versions
nvm install 17.0.0 # Install the specified Node.js version
nvm use 17.0.0 # use the specified Node.js version
nvm alias default 17.0.0 # Set the default Node.js version
nvm alias dev 17.0.0 # Set the alias of the specified version, for example, set the alias of version 17.0.0 to dev
````

**Example**:
```bash
$ nvm use 16
Now using node v16.9.1 (npm v7.21.1)
$ node -v
v16.9.1
$ nvm use 14
Now using node v14.18.0 (npm v6.14.15)
$ node -v
v14.18.0
$ nvm install 12
Now using node v12.22.6 (npm v6.14.5)
$ node -v
v12.22.6
````
Simple as that!

## 2. n

‚≠ê *Github stars: 16.7K+*

[n](https://github.com/tj/n) is an interactive Node.js version manager: no subshells, no profile setup, no convoluted API, just simple.

`n` is supported on macOS, Linux, including with Windows Subsystem for Linux, and various other unix-like systems. It is written as a BASH script but does not require you to use BASH as your command shell.

### Installation

If you already have Node.js installed, an easy way to install `n` is using npm:

```bash
npm install n -g
````

[Third Party Installers](https://github.com/tj/n#third-party-installers)

### Common commands

```bash
n # show all downloaded versions
n 10.16.0 # Download the specified version
n lts # View all LTS Node.js versions remotely
n run 10.16.0 # run the specified Node.js version
````

Use the `n -h` command to read help information, there are these main commands:

```bash
  n Display downloaded Node.js versions and install selection
  n latest Install the latest Node.js release (downloading if necessary)
  n lts Install the latest LTS Node.js release (downloading if necessary)
  n <version> Install Node.js <version> (downloading if necessary)
  n install <version> Install Node.js <version> (downloading if necessary)
  n run <version> [args ...] Execute downloaded Node.js <version> with [args ...]
  n which <version> Output path for downloaded node <version>
  n exec <vers> <cmd> [args...] Execute command with modified PATH, so downloaded node <version> and npm first
  n rm <version ...> Remove the given downloaded version(s)
  n prune Remove all downloaded versions except the installed version
  n --latest Output the latest Node.js version available
  n --lts Output the latest LTS Node.js version available
  n ls Output downloaded versions
  n ls-remote [version] Output matching versions available for download
  n uninstall Remove the installed Node.js
````
