Today, I will share 6 VSCode extensions necessary for Vue3 development, which can be installed and used directly through the VSCode extension center.

If you find it helpful, please like and support it~

## 1. Volar

*üî• 1.53 million downloads+*

I believe that students who use VSCode to develop Vue2 must be familiar with the Vetur extension. As a VSCode extension supporting Vue2, its main function is to provide highlighting, syntax support and syntax detection for Vue single-file components.

With the release of the official version of Vue3, the Vue team officially recommends the [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) extension to replace the Vetur extension, which not only supports Vue3 language highlighting, syntax detection, Also supports TypeScript and type checking based on [vue-tsc](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/tree/master/packages/vue-tsc).

Note when using:

1. First, disable the Vetur extension to avoid conflicts;
2. It is recommended to use `css`/`less`/`scss` as the language for `<style>`, because these are based on [vscode-css-language](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-css-languageservice ) the service provides reliable language support;
3. If using `postcss`/`stylus`/`sass`, additional syntax highlighting extensions need to be installed. postcss uses [language-postcss](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cpylua.language-postcss), stylus uses [language-stylus](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName =sysoev.language-stylus) extension, sass uses [Sass](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Syler.sass-indented) extension;
4. Volar does not contain ESLint and Prettier, while the official [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com /items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension supports Vue, so you need to install it yourself.

## 2. Vue VSCode Snippets

*üî• 1.52 million downloads+*

[Vue VSCode Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.vue-vscode-snippets) extension aims to provide developers with the easiest and fastest way to generate Vue code snippets, through various shortcuts key to quickly generate various code snippets in `.vue` files.
